    <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
    <h3>Oregon State University 2021 — Present</h3>
    Master of Computer Science. GPA: 3.7 / 4.0
    Member at Association of Computer Machinery (ACM)
    Courses: Algorithm, Graphic, Cyber Attack and Defense

    <h3>Oregon State University 2018 — 2021</h3>
    Bachelor of Computer Science. GPA: 3.7 / 4.0
    Courses: Algorithm, Data Structure, Operating System, Database, Cloud Application Development

    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
    <h3>Software Application Development || Restful API | Docker | MongoDB | JavaScript | HTML | CSS</h3>

    • Created the Restful API for the users to access the data from the database.
    • Compared the advantages between MySQL and MongoDB and finally established MongoDB database inside of Docker.
    • Developed and implemented Restful cloud services and interface (Restful API), an architectural style and approach
    to
    communications used in modern cloud services development.
    <h3>Drone Telemetry Data with Block-Chain || Docker | JavaScript | Restful API | MongoDB</h3>

    • Encrypted data with symmetrical encryption and persisted in the database.
    • Designed and developed a full-stack system to monitor the telemetry data and set up the block-chain operation
    environment.
    • Implemented socket to create client-server module to send and receive 10 drones’ data simultaneously in real-time.
    <h3>Amazon Web Server architecture and Mock server || AWS | Docker | Swift | Rust | SourceTree</h3>

    • Designed mock service and network architecture using E2.
    • Configured S3 storage bucket policies and handled sharing data between multiple AWS accounts.
    • Used ECS to create a Docker container cluster and configure VPCs, subnets and routing tables, and set up best
    practice security
    group configurations.
    <h3>Cyber Attack War Game || Python | Pwntools | GNU debugger</h3>

    • Reversed the programs and analyzed where the vulnerabilities existed.
    • Escalated the privilege of the specified application then accessed the hidden password.
    • Applied re-engineering method to check which instruction could be used in application to push or pop the data to
    the correct register.
    • Successfully cracked more than 80 system vulnerabilities tests, mainly bypassed buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    <h3>Graphic: Binary star system || OpenGL | C++ | Shader | Git</h3>
    • Generated 3D objects and formatted them with texture and lighting.
    • Used unique control function to load .obj file and formulated to show the special effects like waves onto the
    object
